                    "One year ago, recent Portland transplant Ellie Oliver had her dream job in animation and a Christmas Eve meet-cute with a 
                    woman at a bookstore that led her to fall in love over the course of a single night. But after a betrayal the next morning 
                    and the loss of her job soon after, she finds herself adrift, alone, and desperate for money.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Finding work at a local coffee shop, she's just getting through the days—until Andrew, the shop's landlord, proposes a shocking, 
                    drunken plan: a marriage of convenience that will give him his recent inheritance and alleviate Ellie's financial woes and 
                    isolation. They make a plan to spend the holidays together at his family cabin to keep up the ruse. But when Andrew introduces 
                    his new fiancée to his sister, Ellie is shocked to discover it's Jack—the mysterious woman she fell for over the course of one magical
                    Christmas Eve the year before. Now, Ellie must choose between the safety of a fake relationship and the risk of something real."

                    adoptive mother doesn't casually eviscerate one of their neighbors. Again.

                    <br>
                    And most days, she can almost accept that she'll never know the truth-that she'll never know why humanity was deemed too dangerous to exist"

                    <span>The Last Juror </span>by John Grisham
                </h4>
                <p>
                    "In 1970, Willie Traynor came to Clanton, Mississippi, in a Triumph Spitfire and a fog of vague ambitions. 
                    Within a year, the twenty-three-year-old found himself the owner of Ford County's only newspaper, famous for 
                    its well-crafted obituaries. While the rest of America was in the grips of turmoil, Clanton lived on the edge 
                    of another age—until the brutal murder of a young mother rocked the town and thrust Willie into the center 
                    of a storm. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Daring to report the true horrors of the crime, Willie made as many friends as enemies in Clanton, 
                    and over the next decade he would sometimes wonder how he had gotten there in the first place. But he could never 
                    escape the crime that had shattered his innocence or the criminal whose evil had left an indelible stain. 
                    Because as the ghosts of the South's past gather around Willie, as tension swirls around Clanton, men and 
                    women who served on a jury nine years ago are starting to die one by one—as a killer exacts the ultimate revenge. . . ."
